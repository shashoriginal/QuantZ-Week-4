## 1. Introduction

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the interactive games developed by **Shashank Raj** and used by **QuantZ** to enhance studentsâ€™ understanding of quantitative finance concepts. The games offer a unique learning experience that integrates real-world investment and trading strategies with simulated environments.

The Week 4 games are designed to enable players to engage with advanced financial metrics, understand the dynamics of market conditions, and test out trading algorithms in a risk-free setting. The games covered in this documentation are:

1. **Portfolio Pursuit** ðŸ’¼ - A portfolio management game that focuses on effective capital allocation and risk management.
2. **Algorithmic Arena** ðŸ¤– - A strategy-building game that allows players to design and implement trading algorithms.

These games serve as powerful tools to facilitate experiential learning, enabling students to grasp complex financial theories through interactive simulations.

## 2. Games Overview

### 2.1. Portfolio Pursuit ðŸ’¼

**Portfolio Pursuit** is a comprehensive investment management simulation where players allocate their virtual capital across various asset classes over multiple rounds, each with its unique market conditions. The game aims to teach players how to balance risk and return effectively, adapt to changing market dynamics, and employ strategic decision-making to achieve the highest returns.

#### Key Features:
- **Dynamic Market Conditions:** Each round introduces a new market condition, such as Bull Market, Bear Market, Sector Boom, etc., impacting the performance of assets.
- **Multiple Asset Classes:** Players can invest in Stocks, Bonds, Commodities, and ETFs, each with different expected returns and volatilities.
- **Score-Based System:** Players earn points based on portfolio returns, Sharpe ratio, and risk management. Penalties are incurred for negative returns and high Value at Risk (VaR).

### 2.2. Algorithmic Arena ðŸ¤–

**Algorithmic Arena** challenges players to design, develop, and test trading algorithms over multiple rounds under varying market conditions. The game enables players to explore how different strategies perform in bull, bear, sideways, and volatile markets.

#### Key Features:
- **Strategy Customization:** Choose from strategies like Moving Average Crossover, Mean Reversion, RSI, and Bollinger Bands.
- **Parameter Tuning:** Adjust critical parameters like window periods, RSI thresholds, and volatility levels to optimize strategy performance.
- **Performance Metrics:** Players receive feedback on strategy returns, capital growth, and strategy robustness.

## 3. Game Setup

### 3.1. Installation

To run the games in a Jupyter Notebook environment, ensure that the following packages are installed:

```bash
pip install -q ipywidgets
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension --sys-prefix --quiet
```

### 3.2. Running the Games

After installing the required packages, simply run the cells containing the game code in your Jupyter Notebook. Each game will display an introductory interface with a "Start Game" button. Click on it to initiate gameplay.

## 4. Portfolio Pursuit Game Mechanics

### 4.1. Game Objective

The objective of **Portfolio Pursuit** is to allocate capital effectively among a variety of assets over a series of 10 rounds. Players aim to maximize returns while managing risk, responding to dynamically changing market conditions each round.

### 4.2. Game Rules

1. **Starting Capital:** Each player starts with an initial capital of $10,000.
2. **Asset Allocation:** Allocate capital among assets like Stock A, Stock B, Bond A, Commodities, and ETFs. Ensure the total allocation does not exceed your current capital.
3. **Market Conditions:** Market conditions vary each round, including scenarios like Bull Market, Bear Market, Stable Market, and Sector Booms. Each condition affects asset performance differently.
4. **Scoring and Penalties:** Earn points for positive returns and good Sharpe ratio. Penalties are applied for negative returns and high Value at Risk (VaR).
